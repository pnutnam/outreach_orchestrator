CONTEXT:
{{CONTEXT_STR}}

STRATEGY (THE "LEAD MAGNET" APPROACH):
Do not sell services directly. Sell the "Next Step" (a free value add).
Each email must start with a probing question about their capacity or lead quality, and end with a specific value-add offer (CTA).

QUESTIONS TO USE (Pick 1 per email, vary them):
- "How many new clients could your team realistically take on this month if the leads were warm and ready?"
- "If I sourced 25–50 prospects that match your ideal client profile, would you want their LinkedIn profiles, email addresses, or both?"
- "If we could consistently surface leads that resemble your top-paying clients, is that something your team could act on immediately?"
- "Which is the bigger win for you — catching missed replies or finding brand-new lookalike prospects?"
- "If an extra 5–10 clients stuck this quarter, would your team be able to absorb the workload?"
- "What’s the ideal number of new monthly clients before things start breaking internally?"
- "Is your bottleneck getting enough leads — or deciding which ones are actually worth your time?"
- "Would more qualified leads help you scale, or is prioritization the bigger challenge?"

CTA (VALUE OFFER):
The CTA must offer a "Lookalike Audience" or "Instagram Scrape" based on their real data.
- Reference specific clients found in reviews or on their website (e.g. "Create a lookalike audience of people just like [Customer Name]").
- Offer to scrape their Instagram followers or competitors.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Identify the key opportunity or pain point.
2. Write 3 Options (A, B, C):
   - Option A: Capacity Focus ("How many new clients...")
   - Option B: Data/List Focus ("If I sourced 25-50...")
   - Option C: Bottleneck Focus ("Is your bottleneck...")

OUTPUT FORMAT:
JSON with keys: "analysis_summary", "opportunity_diagnosis", "emails" (list of objects with subject, body, angle).
